Simple-PGP is a desktop application which you can use to manage your PGP keys, contacts public keys, and easily encrypt and decrypt text for safe communication with the PGP encryption protocol.

Simple PGP is an open source option for using PGP encryption and is built with React, Electron and Mobx. I hope you enjoy using it and please feel free to provide feedback as I'm sure there are still many things left to do on this project.
